      <p class="mx-auto mb-16 text-lg font-lg font-semibold text-black max-w-lg">My name is Lievan P. Alaman, and I'm a 24-year-old Cordova Public third-year irregular college student. As a Working Student, I welcome the challenge of balancing academic pursuits and professional obligations. Looking into the field of coding, I've realized that, while it may appear scary at first, it eventually comes down to dedication and self-study. By immersing myself in every aspect of coding, I attempt to understand each topic and technique, setting the groundwork for a bright future. With determination as my guide, I negotiate the difficulties of programming, believing that constant learning is essential for success.
